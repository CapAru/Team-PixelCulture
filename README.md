# Project: Cultural Canvas | Team: PixelCulture 
# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Bengal's diverse cultural heritage can be challenging for tourists to navigate. Also, local artists and small businesses don't get to showcase their talents and skills to a wider community. This complexity makes it hard for visitors to identify key attractions, local cuisines, and cultural nuances, posing hurdles in their travel experience as well as challenges for the artists to sustain their households, depending on their skills

# SOLUTION:
Introducing Cultural Canvas â€“ a platform dedicated to promoting the local artists, food, culture, and tourism in West Bengal, India. We believe in not just showcasing the beauty of Bengal, but also in contributing to the UN Sustainable Development Goals for the welfare of people, both locally and globally.
